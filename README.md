# 3D Project - Asian Soldier

This repository contains a 3D graphics project completed as part of the **INF443 - Informatique Graphique 3D** course. The project demonstrates concepts in 3D modeling, rendering, and transformations, showcasing various techniques learned throughout the course.

## Project Overview

- **Course**: Computer Graphics
- **Objective**: Create a 3D model and demonstrate transformations, lighting effects, and camera manipulation.
- **Tools Used**: [Specify any software or libraries, e.g., OpenGL, Three.js, Blender, etc.]

## Key Features

- **3D Modeling**: The project includes complex 3D models built from scratch or using predefined primitives.
- **Lighting and Shading**: Implements multiple light sources, including ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting.
- **Camera Control**: Provides user controls for rotating, zooming, and panning the camera to explore the model from various angles.
- **Transformations**: Demonstrates object scaling, rotation, and translation, showcasing real-time interaction.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/3D_Project.git
   cd 3D_Project
