# 3D Project - Asian Soldier

This repository contains a 3D graphics project completed as part of the **INF443 - Informatique Graphique 3D** course. The project demonstrates concepts in 3D modeling, rendering, and transformations, showcasing various techniques learned throughout the course.

## Project Overview

- **Course**: Computer Graphics
- **Objective**: Create and animate a 3D model with textures and vertices manipulation, applying lighting and transformation effects.
- **Tools Used**: CGP library (similar to OpenGL)

## Key Features

- **3D Modeling**: Includes complex 3D models built from scratch, using primitive shapes and custom geometry.
- **Textures and Shading**: Implements texture mapping, including diffuse and specular shading, for realistic surface details.
- **Animation**: Demonstrates animated sequences, including object transformations, rotations, and vertex manipulation for dynamic effects.
- **Vertices Manipulation**: Utilizes vertices for detailed geometry adjustments and mesh deformations.
- **Lighting Effects**: Incorporates multiple light sources such as ambient, point, and directional lighting.
