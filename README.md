# 3D Project - Asian Soldier

This repository contains a 3D graphics project completed as part of the **INF443 - Informatique Graphique 3D** course. The project demonstrates an Asian Soldier walking among the frog and the mountains. She can step forward and back, performing different sword skills when pressing different buttons, demonstrating concepts in 3D modeling, rendering, and transformations, showcasing various techniques learned throughout the course.

## Project Overview

- **Course**: Computer Graphics
- **Objective**: Create and animate a 3D model with textures and vertices manipulation, applying lighting and transformation effects.
- **Tools Used**: CGP library (similar to OpenGL)

## Key Features

- **3D Modeling**: Includes complex 3D models built from scratch, using primitive shapes and custom geometry.
- **Textures and Shading**: Implements texture mapping, including diffuse and specular shading, for realistic surface details.
- **Animation**: Demonstrates animated sequences, including object transformations, rotations, and vertex manipulation for dynamic effects.
- **Vertices Manipulation**: Utilizes vertices for detailed geometry adjustments and mesh deformations.
- **Lighting Effects**: Incorporates multiple light sources such as ambient, point, and directional lighting.
